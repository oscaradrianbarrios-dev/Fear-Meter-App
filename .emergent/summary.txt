<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested the implementation of a multilingual language selector for the Fear Meter application. Over the course of the session, the user expanded the scope significantly, providing a series of master prompts to evolve the application's features and aesthetic.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (Consolidated from multiple user prompts):

1.  **Language Selector (Completed)**: Add a language selector in the side menu for 9 languages, with persistence via .
2.  **Smartwatch Redesign (Completed)**: Redesign the Watch Mode to be an intimidating, circular, full-screen interface focused on a large BPM display and a pulsating biometric ring.
3.  **Psychological Horror UX (Completed & Refined)**: Polish the app's UX to feel less like a common app and more like a serious, unsettling biometric system. This included reducing animations, creating a more biological oscilloscope, using clinical text, and making the side menu more austere.
4.  **Nightmare Protocol (Completed & Refined)**: Enhance the existing Nightmare Protocol to be a passive, silent monitoring mode that detects simulated nightmares (BPM > 120 for 8s) and logs them, with a minimal, dark UI.
5.  **Aesthetic & Audio Overhaul (In Progress)**:
    *   **Color**: Change all reds to a pure, vibrant  with a subtle glow effect on text to make it burn against the black background. The oscilloscope line should be 3px thick and bright.
    *   **Audio**: Implement a dynamic, clinical audio system with a synthetic heartbeat beep that synchronizes with the visual BPM, changes pitch with urgency, and includes a faint background static for texture. A mute toggle should be available.
6.  **New Feature Modules (Completed)**:
    *   **Fear Library**: A section with simulated data for horror movies, games, and attractions, showing fear metrics.
    *   **Global Fear Ranking**: A simulated leaderboard.
    *   **Movie Session Mode**: A feature to simulate watching a movie with a real-time fear event timeline.
    *   **VR Experience**: A placeholder UI to connect a VR headset for a fear-based video experience.
    *   **Fear Challenge**: A game mode with a global leaderboard to see how long users can stay calm.
    *   **Biometric Profile**: A feature to generate a fear profile (e.g., Jump Scare Sensitive) with a radar chart.
    *   **Fear Sharing**: A feature to create and share survivor cards on social media.
7.  **Future Concepts**:
    *   **Advanced Calibration**: Differentiate between rest, exercise, and fear.
    *   **Real-time VR Video Generation**: Generate videos in the VR experience based on the user's live BPM.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish. The next agent MUST respond in Spanish.

**what currently exists?**
The Fear Meter is a feature-rich, frontend-only React application designed as a psychological horror-themed biometric simulator. It is fully functional with a comprehensive set of simulated features, including: a multilingual language selector, a redesigned smartwatch mode, a sophisticated Nightmare Protocol for sleep monitoring, an extensive Fear Library, a Movie Session simulator, a Fear Challenge leaderboard, a Biometric Profile generator, and social sharing cards. The entire application's data is simulated and state is managed via React hooks, Context API, and .

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was performing a major aesthetic and audio overhaul based on the user's latest request. This involved two parallel tasks:
    1.  **UI Redesign**: Converting all red colors to a vibrant, pure red () and adding a glow effect to text and borders for a high-contrast, laser-like look.
    2.  **Audio System**: Implementing a dynamic, clinical audio system using the Web Audio API to generate a synthetic heartbeat beep that syncs with the visual oscilloscope, changes pitch based on BPM, and includes background static.
*   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done**: N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The screenshot tool will also be crucial for visually verifying the new high-contrast color scheme and glow effects. Manual interaction is needed to test the new dynamic audio.

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1**: Complete the UI and Audio Overhaul (Priority: P0)
    *   **Attempted fixes**: The agent started overwriting/editing multiple files:  for the new colors and glow,  for the thicker/brighter line,  for the new sound logic,  for the new mute control, and updated various components like  and  to use the new styles.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Review all component files (, , , etc.) to ensure the new  color and  class have been applied consistently to all relevant elements.
        2.  Verify the implementation in  correctly generates the synthetic beep, syncs with the BPM, changes pitch at the specified thresholds (110 & 130 BPM), and includes the background static.
        3.  Check  to ensure the new  component is correctly integrated and functional.
        4.  Run the application and perform a full visual and auditory test.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will fulfill the user's latest and most critical request to make the app's aesthetic more intimidating, vibrant, and sonically immersive, shifting from a dark to a high-contrast horror theme.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: None.

    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    *   **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    *   **(P1) Advanced Calibration Mode**: Implement the advanced calibration menu to distinguish between rest, physical activity (e.g., running), emotional stress, and fear, potentially by simulating motion detection to exclude exercise from the Fear Score. This was part of a previous user prompt but was not implemented.
*   **Future Tasks**:
    *   **(P2) Real-time VR Video Generation**: Implement the logic for the  experience to dynamically generate or switch between different video clips based on the user's live BPM, as requested by the user. Currently, it's just a placeholder UI.
    *   **(P2) Web Bluetooth API Integration**: Explore and implement connectivity with real heart rate monitors via the Web Bluetooth API to replace the simulated data with real biometric data. This was a suggestion derived from a user request.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend**: React, React Hooks (, , , ).
*   **State Management**: Combination of local component state, React Context (, ) for global settings, and  for persistence (language, calibration, disclaimer).
*   **Routing**:  for managing all application views.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for layout, supplemented by a dedicated  file for custom styles, animations, and CSS variables for theming.
*   **Audio**: Web Audio API used in  for dynamic, synthetic sound generation (beeps, static).
*   **Internationalization (i18n)**: A manual i18n system built with a JS translations object and managed via .

**key DB schema**
N/A. Frontend-only application. Data is persisted in .
*   : Stores the selected language.
*   : Stores calibration data.
*   : Stores nightmare events.
*   : Tracks if the user has accepted the disclaimer.
*   : Will likely store audio settings.

**changes in tech stack**
*   **Web Audio API**: The new  hook makes direct use of the Web Audio API (, , ) for sound synthesis, which is a new addition to the tech stack.

**All files of reference**
*   **/app/frontend/src/styles/horror-ux.css**: Central file for colors, animations, and the new glow effect.
*   **/app/frontend/src/hooks/useClinicalAudio.js**: Core logic for the new dynamic sound system.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Oscilloscope.jsx**: Heavily modified for both visual biological feel and now the new high-contrast laser look.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/SoundToggle.jsx**: The new UI control for muting/unmuting audio.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Header.jsx**: Contains the main menu toggle and the new sound toggle.
*   **All new component files**: , , , , , .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   **State Management**: While  and  were added, the core biometric state (BPM, stress, status, etc.) is still managed in  and passed down via props. Introducing a  would centralize this state, remove prop drilling, and make the state easily accessible to components like  (for heartbeat sync) or  without complex prop chains.

**key api endpoints**
N/A.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   **Aesthetic is Paramount**: The user has a very specific and evolving vision. The latest directive is a high-contrast, vibrant, laser-like aesthetic using pure red () and glow effects. Adhere strictly to this.
*   **Audio is Dynamic**: The new audio system is not just playing sound files; it's synthesizing them in real-time based on the application's state (BPM).
*   **App is a Simulation**: All data is mocked. Do not attempt to connect to a real backend.
*   **Unreproduced Crash**: Be aware that the user reported the app closing. While not reproducible by the previous agent, keep an eye out for potential stability issues.
