<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to add a language selector to the Fear Meter application. The request is to act as a senior UX Engineer to implement this feature.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Location**: The selector must be placed inside the hidden side menu under a Language section.
2.  **Functionality**:
    *   It should display a vertical list of available languages.
    *   Only one language can be active at a time.
    *   The application's UI must update immediately upon selection without a page reload.
    *   The chosen language must be saved to  for persistence.
3.  **Available Languages**: English (default), Español, Português, Italiano, 日本語, 中文, Aleman, Ruso, Frances.
4.  **Visual Style**:
    *   Background: Absolute black ().
    *   Text (Inactive): Gray ().
    *   Text (Selected): Pure red () with a fine red underline and a subtle red glow.
    *   Font: JetBrains Mono.
    *   No icons or country flags should be used.
5.  **Animations**:
    *   A smooth fade-in and a micro vertical slide when the menu opens.
    *   The interaction should be clean, without sounds or other distractions, to maintain the app's serious, clinical tone.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish. The next agent MUST respond in Spanish.

**what currently exists?**
The Fear Meter is a sophisticated, frontend-only horror application that simulates biometric monitoring. The agent has successfully implemented several complex features:
-   A **Calibration System** to differentiate between exercise, stress, and fear, which persists its state in .
-   A **Nightmare Protocol** for silent, automatic detection of fear events during sleep, complete with a log and a test mode.
-   An **Investor Demo Mode**, a self-running, scripted sequence accessible via a dedicated URL () designed for presentations.
-   A **Psychological Horror UX** layer, which enhances the application's atmosphere with unsettling micro-interactions, clinical text, and an asymmetric UI.

The agent just performed a full review of all features and confirmed they are working correctly before starting the new language selector task.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: The agent started implementing the multilingual language selector. The first step taken was to create the file , which will contain the text strings for all supported languages.
*   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done**: N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent should also use the  for visual verification of the styling and animations of the new language selector component.
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending issues or bugs.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1**: Implement the Multilingual Language Selector (Priority: P0)
    *   **Where to resume**: The agent has created . The next logical step, as indicated by the agent's last thought, is to create the  component.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?**: This will allow users to change the application's display language. The selection will be persisted across sessions using , enhancing accessibility and user experience.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    *   **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no other future tasks requested by the user at this time.

**Completed work in this session**
*   **Calibration System V2 (DONE)**: Implemented persistence via , configurable duration, and expiration warnings (, ).
*   **Nightmare Protocol (DONE)**: Created a nocturnal fear detection mode with a separate UI, event log, and a test mode (, ).
*   **Investor Demo Mode (DONE)**: Built a self-contained, scripted demo sequence for presentations at  ().
*   **Psychological Horror UX (DONE)**: Enhanced the UI with unsettling micro-interactions, clinical messaging, and an asymmetric layout (, updated various components).
*   **Full Application Review (DONE)**: The agent performed a comprehensive visual review of all features, confirming functionality and visual consistency.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All identified issues, such as linting errors and a progress bar bug, were resolved during the session.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend**: React, React Hooks (, , , ).
*   **State Management**:  is used for persisting language preference and calibration data across sessions. Component state and props are used for local UI management.
*   **Routing**:  is used to manage different views like the main app, Nightmare Protocol, and the Investor Demo.
*   **Styling**: A combination of Tailwind CSS for layout and a dedicated CSS file () for custom animations and the horror aesthetic.
*   **Internationalization (i18n)**: A manual i18n system is being built using a translations object.

**key DB schema**
N/A. This is a frontend-only application. Data is persisted in the browser's .
*   : Stores baseline biometric data.
*   : Will store the user's selected language.
*   : Stores detected nightmare events.

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
*   **/app/frontend/src/i18n/translations.js**: Newly created to hold all UI strings for different languages.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/LanguageSelector.jsx**: The next file to be created. It will contain the UI for language selection.
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main router. It will need to be aware of the language state.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/SideMenu.jsx**: Needs modification to include a Language option that opens the new selector.
*   All components with display text will need to be refactored to consume the strings from the  object based on the selected language.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   **Prop Drilling**: The language state will be needed by many components. To avoid excessive prop drilling, the next agent should consider implementing a React Context for global state management (e.g., language). This would be a cleaner solution than passing props down multiple levels or relying solely on  for state propagation between components.

**key api endpoints**
N/A. The application is entirely frontend-based and simulates all data.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   **Aesthetic is Key**: The user has a very specific vision for a psychological horror aesthetic. All new UI must adhere strictly to the established style guide (black/red/gray,  font, unsettling micro-interactions).
*   ** Testing**: Be aware that automated testing tools may use isolated sessions that clear  on each navigation. For features relying on persistence (like language selection), manual testing within a single browser tab is crucial to confirm correct behavior.
*   **Frontend Only**: The entire application is a simulation. There is no backend or database to consider.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
*   : Updated multiple times with test results and feature completion summaries.
*   : Not used in this session.
